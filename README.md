# Weapon Masteries 5e
A Foundry VTT module to automate 5e system's weapon masteries (**requires** Automated Conditions 5e module)

Click on the chat message Mastery link to use it.

Works for the following weapons masteries:
* `Cleave`
* `Graze`
* `Nick` (nothing to automate)
* `Push`
* `Sap`
* `Slow`
* `Topple`
* `Vex`

As the system uses left click to open the Journal entry for each mastery, WM5e changes that behavior.

To open the Journal entries you can instead right click on the mastery link.

SHIFT + left click on the weapon mastery will bypass rules like: "Needs a successful attack to use".
